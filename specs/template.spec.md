## 6. Steps

> **Python environment (v0.5.2+):** Spectre creates `state/.venv/` automatically.
> Write bare `python3 script.py` or `pip install -e .` — the executor rewrites
> them to use the venv interpreter. Do **not** hard-code `.venv/bin/python` or
> declare `--break-system-packages` in actions.

Each step is an atomic transaction with three required keys plus optional contract and resource fields:
- `why:` one-line first-principles justification — *not* analogy. This is the "Reasoning in Public" line that gets printed before the action runs.
- `action:` the exact shell command to execute (single line, no pipes spanning multiple commands unless necessary).
- `verification:` the exact shell command that must exit 0 to prove the action succeeded.
- `produces:` (optional) — list of contract entries this step creates. Each entry is `<type>:<value>`. The evaluator uses these to resolve later steps' `requires:` entries. Omitting produces/requires is allowed but emits a `missing-contract` warning (non-blocking).
- `requires:` (optional) — list of contract entries this step needs. Every entry must appear in some prior step's `produces:`, or the evaluator emits an `unowned-requirement` block finding.
- `properties:` (optional) — list of PBT-lite assertions the State Auditor will check after `verification` passes. Each property has `kind:` (one of `type` / `schema` / `length` / `range`), `target:` (path to a JSON file), and kind-specific fields. See `bin/auditor.py` for supported shapes. Auditor verdicts are informational, not blocking — they land in scratchpad and the next compact's additionalContext.
- `resources:` (optional) — list of Resource node IDs this step needs to acquire before executing. Each entry is a string matching a Resource node in `specs/.graph.md`. The supervisor grants access; if at capacity, the track queues. Released automatically after the step's verification passes (or on terminal halt).

**Contract types** (for `produces:` and `requires:`). Type prefixes are lowercase (`package:`, not `Package:`):
- `file:<path>` — absolute path to a file authored by the action
- `package:<name>` — Python package made importable (e.g. via `pip install -e .`)
- `console-script:<name>` — shell-PATH-resolvable command registered by an editable install
- `route:<METHOD> <path>` — HTTP route added (e.g. `route:POST /api/convert`)
- `module:<dotted.name>` — Python module path
- `binary:<name>` — system binary available on PATH (yt-dlp, curl, pip)
- `db-table:<name>` — SQLite table created
- `db-column:<table>.<col>` — column on a table

```yaml
- step: 1
  why: "<one-line justification grounded in first principles>"
  action: "pip install mypackage"
  verification: "python3 -c 'import mypackage'"
  produces:
    - "package:mypackage"
    - "console-script:mypackage-cli"

- step: 2
  why: "<one-line justification grounded in first principles>"
  action: "mypackage-cli --setup > /opt/mypackage/config.json"
  verification: "test -f /opt/mypackage/config.json"
  requires:
    - "package:mypackage"
    - "console-script:mypackage-cli"
  produces:
    - "file:/opt/mypackage/config.json"
  properties:                     # OPTIONAL — auditor runs PBT-lite checks if present
    - kind: type                  # type | schema | length | range
      target: "/opt/mypackage/config.json"
      expected: dict

- step: 3
  why: "Server must bind a known TCP port; lock prevents two tracks racing for it."
  action: "python3 -m http.server 8080"
  verification: "curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8080 > /dev/null"
  resources:
    - res-port-8080

## 8. Receiver Calibration

This section declares the spec author's contract with the executor. Split into hard contract (machine-enforced) and human-facing notes (informational only). The pre-lock spec evaluator (v0.3+) cross-checks §8.1 against actions' actual path captures.

### 8.1 Hard contract (machine-enforced — `block` severity on violation)

Every spec MUST declare the following four fields. The evaluator blocks lock if any are absent or if any action's path captures violate them.

- `mutates:` — comma-separated paths the spec is authorized to write/modify (e.g. `/opt/btc-poller/, /etc/systemd/system/`)
- `never-touches:` — comma-separated paths the spec MUST NOT write to (e.g. `/home, /etc/passwd`)
- `decision-budget:` — paid-API call budget (e.g. `1 paid API call per minute (CoinGecko free tier)` or `none`)
- `reboot-survival:` — `required` | `best-effort` | `none`

### 8.2 Human-facing notes (informational only — `info` severity, never blocks)

Optional. For human reviewers calibrating expectations. The evaluator surfaces these as `info` findings but never blocks on them.

- `assumes:` — what the executor is assumed to know (e.g. `knows-systemd, knows-python-stdlib`)
- `runtime-flavor:` — the host the spec targets (e.g. `A8 (Debian 13, Ryzen 7 8745HS)`)
- `expected-author-skill:` — the spec author's experience tier (e.g. `senior backend engineer`)
